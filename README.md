# Yet-Another-Metaballs-Implementation (YAMI)
Metaballs. Gooey, gloopy, delicious metaballs. Traditional metaball implementations are painstakingly slow and compute intensive, and require optimization and algorithms like marching squares (or cubes) to run in real-time. So I present to you... **YAMI**, a pseudo-metaballs implementation that runs in real-time out of the box and can support any polygon, from circles to squares to hexagons to blocky drawings of dragons. The included demo is just two circles, but you can adjust the incredibly simple code however you'd like.
## Pros v. Cons
### Pros
- YAMI is incredibly fast
- YAMI supports any polygon, unlike most metaball implementations
- YAMI's compute load increases at a slower late than other implementations
### Cons
- YAMI is not true metaballs, but rather a pseudo-metaball implementations
- YAMI isn't always accurate to how true metaballs behave
## Demo
